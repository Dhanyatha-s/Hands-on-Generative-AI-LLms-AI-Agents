# Hands-on-Generative-AI-LLms-AI-Agents
Learning GenAI and LLms through a book by Aman Kharwal

Day 1: Started off with learning about Latent-Space   
and Foundational and Fine-Tuned Learning Model   

#### Mini Project: Generating Text with Hugging face  
Terminology Used:
1. Initilaizing the Text Generation Pipeline  
- Transformer model (library)
  - Pipeline
  - Model - distilgpt2 "text-generation"
2. Define the Prompt  
- prompt
3. Generate Text with Sampling Parameters
  "When we are calling the model to generate the next word it goes through iterative process that involves Sampling"
  - top-K "Most Likely next word"
  - top-p "Consider smallest set of words whose cumulative probability exceeds the threshold of p"
4. Print the Output
